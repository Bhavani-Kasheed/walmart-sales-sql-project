- Use **MySQL window functions** for ranking and cumulative sales.  

## ðŸ“‘ SQL Queries
They are grouped into:  
1. Basic Queries  
2. Filtering & Conditions  
3. Aggregations & Group By  
4. Subqueries & Joins (self)  
5. Date & Time Functions  
6. Advanced Queries (RANK, Cumulative SUM, Pivot style)
